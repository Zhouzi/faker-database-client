# faker-database-client

Fake database client generating structured data.

## Motivation

This library is meant to offer a database layer for coding exercises.
It's a building brick that provides fake data so you can focus on learning new technologies and sharpen your skills.
You can try to recreate Facebook's news feed's backend with GraphQL, learn React by rebuilding Twitter's feed, redesign Instagram, and so on.

Since it's just a set of functions that return structured data, it can be used with whatever you want.
Want to focus on the frontend? Get a backend from the community.
Want to work on some backend? Create an api serving a fake frontend and eventually grab one here.

## Words of caution

While this library sometimes refers to Facebook, Twitter and other products, it is in no way affiliated with them.
Neither it is attempting to recreate their real data structure.
Instead, it provides simpler versions that contains what you'd need to rebuild part of their interface.
